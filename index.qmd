# Preface {.unnumbered}

I first learned to program in 2011 in
[Dr. Richard O. Gray](https://physics.appstate.edu/faculty-staff/dr-richard-o-gray)'s computational physics course. 

It was a revelatory experience that shaped my life. I enjoyed the class so much that I served as the TA the following year and later earned a PhD in Computational Science.

I've kept the lecture notes on my various computers ever since. Rather than posting the original notes unchanged, I'm converting them into a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) book, updating examples from C to Python and adding some of my own material.

Note: Most of the content and examples are taken from Dr. Gray's original course materials.

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
