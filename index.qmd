# Preface {.unnumbered}

I first learned to program in 2011 in
[Dr. Richard O. Gray](https://physics.appstate.edu/faculty-staff/dr-richard-o-gray)'s computational physics course. 

It was a revelatory experience that shaped my life. I enjoyed the class so much
that I served as the TA the following year and later earned a PhD in
Computational Science.

I've kept the lecture notes on my various computers ever since. I want to convert the notes into a
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) book as a conservation project. In addition to replicating the source material 
I want to add some examples from Python and Scipy.

# Colophon {.unnumbered}

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
