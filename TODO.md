# TODO

A loose collection of things to do and open questions.

## General

- Change the `_foo_` to `*foo*` for italics?
- Clean up quotations marks

## Interpolation

- Can callout blocks be numbered automatically?
- Can I reference callout blocks?

## Roots

- Add captions to to the figures?
- Automatic number for the last exercise

## Extrema

- "see the figure below" add ref
- The example refs are getting weird
- Figure out how to add a proper angtrom symbol
- Fix other angtrom symbols in other text
- Cross ref call outs
- Fix "aside" ref
- Make NR simplex figure from scratch. I think this will be a bigger project than I want to take on right now.
- Think about factoring out the style for the plot into a stand alone mplotlib style file.
