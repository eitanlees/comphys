I am working on converting some PDF documents from a computational phyics course into Quarto format. 

I have used a script to extract raw text from the PDFs, but the formatting is not suitable for Quarto markdown.

Can you help me take some raw text extracted from the PDFs and convert it into proper Quarto markdown format?

Make sure to include proper formatting for equations, sections, and any other relevant Quarto features.

There are some specific requirements for the conversion:

- This is a restoration project so be careful to preserve all original content. 
- Focus particularly on converting mathematical equations into LaTeX format suitable for Quarto.
- Don't use \[ \] for equations; instead, use $$ ... $$ for display equations.
- Don't use \( \) for inline equations; instead, use $ ... $ for inline equations.
- Each "Exercise" section should be formatted as a callout note with the title "Exercise X.Y", where X.Y is the exercise number.

Below is an example of raw text extracted from a PDF document I would like you to convert
