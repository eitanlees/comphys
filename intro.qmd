# Introduction

I first learned to program in 2011 in
[Dr. Richard O. Gray](https://physics.appstate.edu/faculty-staff/dr-richard-o-gray)'s computational physics course. 

It was a revelatory experience. It shaped the rest of my life. 

I enjoyed the class so much that the following year I was the TA. 

I went on to get a PhD in Computational Science. 

Ever since I took the course I have kept the lecture notes on my various computers. 

Here I am attempting to convert them to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

I am also thinking of updating the content to Python.

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.
