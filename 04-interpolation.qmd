# Interpolation

## Linear Interpolation

A common computational problem in physics involves determining the value of a
particular function at one or more points of interest from a tabulation of that
function. For instance, we may wish to calculate the index of refraction of a
type of glass at a particular wavelength, but be faced with the problem that
that particular wavelength is not explicitly in the tabulation. In such cases,
we need to be able to interpolate in the table to find the value of the function
at the point of interest. Let us take a particular example.

BK-7 is a type of common optical crown glass. Its index of refraction $n$ varies
as a function of wavelength; for shorter wavelengths $n$ is larger than for longer
wavelengths, and thus violet light is refracted more strongly than red light,
leading to the phenomenon of dispersion. The index of refraction is tabulated in
@tbl-bk-7.

Refractive Index for BK7 Glass

:::

Let us suppose that we wish to find the index of refraction at a wavelength of
$5000Å$. Unfortunately, that wavelength is not found in the table, and so we
must estimate it from the values in the table. We must make some assumption
about how $n$ varies between the tabular values. Presumably it varies in a smooth
sort of way and does not take wild excursions between the tabulated values. The
simplest and quite often an entirely adequate assumption to make is that the
actual function varies linearly between the tabulated values. This is the basis
of **linear interpolation**.

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 4.1"}
Determine, by hand, the value of the index of refraction of BK7 at $5000Å$ using
linear interpolation.
:::

How do we carry out linear interpolation on the computer? Let us suppose that
the function is tabulated at $N$ points and takes on the values $y_1,y_2,y_3 ...
y_N$ at the points $x_1,x_2,x_3 ... x_N$, and that we want to find the value of
the function $y$ at a point $x$ that lies someplace in the interval between
$x_1$ and $x_N$.

The first thing that we must do is to bracket $x$, that is we must find a $j$ such
that $x_j < x \leq x_{j+1}$. This can be accomplished by the following code fragment:

```c
for(i=1;i<N;i++) {
    if(xn[i] < x && xn[i+1] >= x) {
        j = i;
        break; 
    }
}
```

where the `xn`’s are the tabulated points. When the `if` statement is satisfied, `j`
is assigned the value of `i` and the procedure drops out of the loop. Please note
that this is not the most efficient way to accomplish this task, especially if $N$
is very large. We will look at a more efficient way later on.

Once we have bracketed $x$, we can find the equation of the line between the
points $(x_j,y_j)$ and $(x_{j+1},y_{j+1})$. This equation will be of the form $y = mx+b4 where
$m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. As we all know, the slope is given by

$$
m = \frac{y_{j+1}-y_j}{x_{j+1}-x_j}
$$

and the intercept can be found by substituting one point, say, $(x_j,y_j)$ into the resulting equation. Thus,

$$
b=y-mx=y_j-\frac{y_{j+1}-y_j}{x_{j+1}-x_j}x_j
$$

yielding for the equation of the line, after some rearrangement,

$$
y==y_j+\left(\frac{y_{j+1}-y_j}{x_{j+1}-x_j}\right)(x-x_j)
$$


It is left to the student to show (for future reference) that this equation may
be rewritten 
$$
y=Ay_j+By_{j+1}
$$
where
$$
A = \frac{x_{j+1}-x}{x_{j+1}-x_j}
$$
and
$$
B = \frac{x-x_j}{x_{j+1}-x_j}
$$

Write a C-function that will linearly interpolate the tabular data for the index
of refraction of BK-7 and return a value for $n$ for wavelengths between $3511Å$
and $23254Å$. Write a driver program that will use this function to prompt the
user for a wavelength and then print to screen the corresponding value of $n$.

The file `data/boiling.dat` contains data in two columns for the boiling point
of water at different atmospheric pressures. The first column is the pressure in
millibars, the second is the corresponding boiling point temperature in degrees
Celsius. Write a C-function that initializes two vectors, `P` and `T` with the
data in that data file (don’t read in the datafile – hardwire the data into your
program), accepts the pressure as a double floating-point parameter, and returns
the value of the temperature of the boiling point at that pressure. You should
also write a driver program that will prompt the user for an atmospheric
pressure, check whether it is within the limits of the data $(50 ≤ P ≤ 2150)$,
calls your C-function, and prints to the screen the boiling point of water at
that pressure.

## Polynomial Interpolation

Linear interpolation is good enough for government work, and it is even better
than that. Because it is simple and makes the simplest possible assumption about
the data, it should be employed in all cases except where it is manifestly
inadequate. There are such cases. Sometimes the function being interpolated is
very non-linear or has been tabulated at such wide intervals that linear
interpolation would lead to large errors. Some applications demand more than
simply the functional values at the interpolated points; sometimes the
derivative of the function is required as well. With linear interpolation, the
derivative is a constant between the tabulated points, and may actually be
undefined at the tabulated points!

For such applications it may be best to interpolate using a polynomial
interpolating function or functions. It can be shown that the following poly-
nomial $P(x)$ of degree $N−1$ will exactly pass through the N tabulated points of
the function $y = f(x)$:

\begin{align*}
P(x) =\;&
\frac{(x - x_2)(x - x_3)\cdots(x - x_N)}
     {(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_3)\cdots(x_1 - x_N)}\,y_1 \\[1em]
&+ \frac{(x - x_1)(x - x_3)\cdots(x - x_N)}
     {(x_2 - x_1)(x_2 - x_3)\cdots(x_2 - x_N)}\,y_2 \\[1em]
&+ \cdots \\[1em]
&+ \frac{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)\cdots(x - x_{N-1})}
     {(x_N - x_1)(x_N - x_2)\cdots(x_N - x_{N-1})}\,y_N
\end{align*}

The problem with the direct application of the polynomial $P(x)$ is that for
tabulations with many points, it can lead to very high degree polynomials. For
instance, if a function is tabulated at 100 points, the above equation would
yield a polynomial of degree 99! Such a polynomial could potentially fluctuate
wildly between the tabulated points and thus not be a good representation of
the actual function. $P(x)$ is more usually applied to subsets of the tabulated
points. For instance, if the polynomial is applied to subsets of 3 points, it
yields parabolic interpolation, which can be much superior to linear
interpolation if the function has a number of minima and maxima.

One problem with parabolic 3-point interpolation is that when it comes to
bracketing $x$, there is an ambiguity – does one bracket between $x_1$ and $x_2$
or between $x_2$ and $x_3$? This is one reason why cubic 4-point interpolation
is more commonly practiced – the bracketing is then between $x_2$ and $x_3$ with
no ambiguity. Such interpolation is also called Lagrangian 4-point
interpolation. The Lagrangian 4-point interpolation equation can be written:

\begin{align*}
L(x) =\;&
\frac{(x - x_2)(x - x_3)(x - x_4)}
     {(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_3)(x_1 - x_4)}\,y_1 \\[1em]
&+ \frac{(x - x_1)(x - x_3)(x - x_4)}
     {(x_2 - x_1)(x_2 - x_3)(x_2 - x_4)}\,y_2 \\[1em]
&+ \frac{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_4)}
     {(x_3 - x_1)(x_3 - x_2)(x_3 - x_4)}\,y_3 \\[1em]
&+ \frac{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}
     {(x_4 - x_1)(x_4 - x_2)(x_4 - x_3)}\,y_4
\end{align*}

which the student can easily verify by reference to the equation for $P(x)$.

To apply this interpolation equation, the user should first bracket $x$ between
$x_j$ and $x_{j+1}$ as before, but now identify $x_j$ with $x_2$ in the above
equation and $x_{j+1}$ with $x_3$. It then follows that $x_1$ will be $x_{j−1}$
and $x_4$ will be $x_{j+2}$. The perceptive student will see that this will lead
to a problem at the endpoints.  For instance, if $x$ is situated between the
first two tabulated points, $x_{j−1}$ will be undefined. Likewise, if $x$ is
situated between the last two tabulated points, $x_{j+2}$ will be undefined.
Thus in those intervals, the user must either interpolate linearly, or, in the
first case, use the polynomial that would be used for an $x$ bracketed between
the 2nd and 3rd tabulated points, and similarly for the last case.

Write a C-function that will implement the 4-point Lagrangian interpolation
formula above. For the endpoints, use the polynomial that would have been
defined for the adjacent interval as described above. Modify the driver program
in Exercise 4.2 (interpolation in a table of the wavelength and the index of
refraction for BK-7 glass) to use this new C-function. Compare the results
between the two programs.

We have only scratched the surface of the subject of interpolation. The subject
of Extrapolation – finding a value for a function outside the range of the
defined points – is much more dangerous. Interpolation schemes can be used for
extrapolation, but only with great care!

Before we leave the subject of interpolation, let us examine one further
subject, that of efficiently bracketing $x$. If we have a set of $x$’s (say in a
vector `x[i]`) in numerical order that we must find interpolated values for, there
is a simple time saving step that we can use, implemented in the following
fragment of code (assume `x` is a vector of dimension `n`):

```c
j = 1;
for(k=1;k<=n;k++) { 
    for(i=j;i<N;i++) {
        if(xn[i] < x[k] && xn[i+1] >= x[k]) { 
            j = i;
            break; 
        }
    }
    here is your interpolation function code 
}
```

Notice that the second `for` loop begins at `i=j` and not `i=1`; since the $x_k$’s are in
numerical order, if $x_k$ is bracketed between `xn[j]` and `xn[j+1]`, there is no need
to search beginning at `i=1` for $x_{k+1}$ because it will either be bracketed between
the same pair or later pairs (note that we are obviously also assuming that the
`xn[j]`’s are in numerical order). This can save an enormous amount of time in a
code that needs to interpolate in a large (say $N > 100$) table. Another useful
trick is that of bisection. Further notes on bisection and other techniques for
efficiently bracketing $x$ can be found in _Numerical Recipes_.
